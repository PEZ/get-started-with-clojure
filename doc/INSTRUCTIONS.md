# How to use The Getting Started REPL

The Getting Started REPL connects Calva to three files, which will serve as your interactive guides:

- `hello_repl.clj` ‚Äì The basics of how to evaluate code in Calva (i.e. using the REPL)
- `hello_paredit.clj` - A super brief intro to Calva structural editing ([Paredit](https://calva.io/paredit))
- `welcome_to_clojure.clj` - The very basics of the Clojure language

The files contain a mix of guiding text and snippets of code. You will use the REPL to evaluate the code and sometimes you will be asked to write some code and evaluate it. And so on.

If you haven't already, you should start with reading [calva.io/get-started-with-clojure](https://calva.io/get-started-with-clojure/).

If you have never used VS Code before you might want to have a look at [this Getting Started with VS Code video](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics). (You can of course ignore the parts about installing for now.) Or at least have [this overview of the VS Code interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) handy.

There are some difference between regular VS Code and Gitpod's ditto. We'll just help you find the main menu here:

## Let's go!

Fire up the Getting Started REPL:

0. Give the guides some space: Maximize the browser window. Close thee Explorer pane. Shrink the Output/Terminal/Etc pane to about half of what it is now.
1. Click the **REPL** button in the status bar

   <details><summary>Don't see the REPL button?</summary>
    
    This could be because some firewall or adblocker prevents the downloading of the Calva extension. See [issue #9](https://github.com/PEZ/rich4clojure/issues/9) for more clues on this.

1. Select **Fire up the ‚ÄùGetting Started‚Äù REPL** from the quick pick menu.
