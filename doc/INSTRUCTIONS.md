# How to use The Getting Started REPL

The Getting Started REPL connects Calva to three files, which will serve as your interactive guides:

- `hello_repl.clj` – The basics of how to evaluate code in Calva (i.e. using the REPL)
- `hello_paredit.clj` - A super brief intro to Calva structural editing ([Paredit](https://calva.io/paredit))
- `welcome_to_clojure.clj` - The very basics of the Clojure language

The files contain a mix of guiding text and snippets of code. You will use the REPL to evaluate the code and sometimes you will be asked to write some code and evaluate that.

If you haven't already, you should start with reading [calva.io/get-started-with-clojure](https://calva.io/get-started-with-clojure/). 

## Let's go!

First you need to fire up the Getting Started REPL:

1. Click the **REPL** button in the status bar

   <details><summary>Don't see the REPL button?</summary>
    
    This could be because some firewall or adblocker prevents the downloading of the Calva extension. See [issue #9](https://github.com/PEZ/rich4clojure/issues/9) for more clues on this.

1. Select **Fire up the ”Getting Started” REPL** from the quick pick menu.
