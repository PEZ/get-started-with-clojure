## OK, but how?

Start the Gitpod development environment by prepending the URL of this repository with:

`https://gitpod.io#`

If you are not using Safari you can also click this button:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

If you are not signed in on Gitpod you should sign in with the GitHub option

Next, create the Workspace, the defaults will do.

Then it will take a while to pull Docker containers and stuff, but eventually VS Code will open in the browser and with [doc/INSTRUCTIONS.md](doc/INSTRUCTIONS.md) opened. Continue from there.

Happy Interactive Programming ❤️
