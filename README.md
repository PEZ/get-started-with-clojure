# Get Started with Clojure - Zero install

_A zero-install, interactve, guide to get you started with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) using [Calva](https://calva.io/)'s **Getting Started REPL**._

**NB: This Zero install option will stop working on April 1, 2025, when Gitpod is sunsetting what they now call Gitpod Classic. Enjoy it while it lasts! And uncountable thanks to Gitpod for having made this project possible for three years! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è**

**The Get Started with Clojure guide will remain available in Calva. You'll need to have VS Code and Java. See [calva.io/get-started-with-clojure/](https://calva.io/get-started-with-clojure/)**

All that said, and until the sun sets over this project:

## OK, but how?

Start the Gitpod development environment by prepending the URL of this repository with:

`https://gitpod.io#`

If you are not using Safari you can also click this button:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

If you are not signed in on Gitpod you should sign in with the GitHub option

![Sign in to Gitpod with your GitHub account](doc/gitpod-sign-in.png)

Next, create the Workspace, the defaults will do.

Then it will take a while to pull Docker containers and stuff, but eventually VS Code will open in the browser and with [doc/INSTRUCTIONS.md](doc/INSTRUCTIONS.md) opened. Continue from there.

Happy Interactive Programming ‚ù§Ô∏è
